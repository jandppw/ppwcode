# Introduction #

In this section we discuss which tools are used in software development projects in general (client projects, outside ppwcode). This is a general section. You should also refer to the specialized sections about tools used in [Java projects](VernacularToolsJava.md), [.net projects](VernacularToolsDotNet.md), and [SQL projects](VernacularToolsSql.md).

In general, the guidelines for [ppwcode projects](pwpcodeTools.md) apply to projects outside ppwcode too. Here, we only mention differences.


# Details #

There are no deviations from the ppwcode tooling guide at this time.
