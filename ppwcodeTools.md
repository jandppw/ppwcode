# Introduction #

In this section we discuss which tools are used in ppwcode projects. This is a general section. You should also refer to the specialized sections about tools used in [ppwcode Java projects](ppwcodeToolsJava.md), [.net projects](ppwcodeToolsDotNet.md), and [SQL projects](ppwcodeToolsSql.md).

There are separate pages that discuss [tooling used in client projects](VernacularTools.md), outside ppwcode.

## UML ##

For UML drawings, we use Poseidon for [UML Standard Edition, version 5.0](http://www.gentleware.com/uml-software-standard-edition.html).

The reason we chose this package, which is commercial, is that we could not find a cross-plaform F/OSS UML tool that was good enough. A [free Community Edition](http://www.gentleware.com/uml-software-community-edition.html) is available too, which might or might not work with our files.

We do not follow the upgrade cycle of this product closely. At the time of this writing, the latest version is 6.0.2, who's files are not backward compatible to version 5.0.
