<p>This project offers annotations that are intended to put passive
  meta information from development into class files. The information
  can be read using reflection.</p>
<p>The main intention of this library is to be able to embed meta information
  (license, version, ...) in the binary distribution, i.e., the class files,
  of libraries (and other projects).</p>
<p>IDEA: Currently, the project does not offer a reader. The idea is that
  some reader is offered in this project which allows to visualize the
  meta information in classes in a jar easily. By using retention policy
  {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME}, this would be simple,
  since then we could use reflection. This was developed in a simple version in
  a separate branch. As explained in the package documentation though,
  this would make it a big hurdle for libraries to use this project,
  because it introduces undue runtime dependencies for their users.
  A reader that peeks into jar files, and reads (parses) class files,
  should be made. This seems quite difficult at this time. In any
  case, having the information in the class files helps a lot. If,
  without the reader, a developer wants to see the meta information,
  opening the class file with a text editor works too. The meta
  information stands out.</p>
