    <p>Time intervals are dangerously and treacherously difficult to reason about.
      Experience shows that falling back to the begin and end dates as separated dates and
      reasoning about them does not solve the complexity, and results in even more difficult
      reasonings and is even more error prone.</p>
    <p>{@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.interval.TimeInterval} is an interface where we define
      the general rules for time intervals in our approach. This package offers several effective
      implementations, that have different constraints that they adhere to. For each of these
      implementations, persistence support and other translation support is offered.</p>
    <p>Reasoning about time intervals should be done with Allen's Interval Algebra. This is
      implemented in {@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.interval.TimeIntervalRelation}. To reason
      about the relation between time intervals and points in time, please use
      {@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.interval.TimePointIntervalRelation}.</p>
    <h3>OpenJPA Value Handlers</h3>
    <p>Sadly, JPA as a standard does not support &quot;user types&quot;
      or &quot;custom types&quot; or &quot;value types&quot; as any
      reasonable other technology does, from Hibernate over OpenJPA, but
      also including Struts, JSF, dwr, json-lib, and many, many others.
      Therefor, we introduce the OpenJPA solution, which can be used in OpenJPA
      contexts, and other solutions for other contexts. In this package, you find value handler
      implementations next to the different interval classes.</p>
    <p>Note that {@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.interval.DeterminateIntradayTimeInterval}
      properties can use the
      {@link org.ppwcode.value_III.time.interval.IntradayTimeIntervalValueHandler} too.</p>
