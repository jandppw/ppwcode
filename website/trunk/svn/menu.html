      <p>The version control system we use, is <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>. 
      Several tools are already available to make working with Subversion repositories more convenient.
      Two noteworthy tools are <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org">TortoiseSVN</a> and 
      <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org">Subclipse</a>.  Still, for some tasks we did not find any existing
      tools and developed our own.</p>

      <p>Subversion supports attaching metadata to files through the use of properties.  Properties
      are versioned in the same way that files are versioned.  A number of predefined <i>special</i>
      properties guide Subversion in the way it should treat a file.  Some examples are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>svn:eol-style</b> This property indicates whether Subversion should enforce a certain
        type of end-of-line encoding (such as, CRLF, LF, CR, or native to the client platform) when
        checking out a text file.</li>
        <li><b>svn:mime-type</b> This property contains the mime-type of the file.  When this property is
        available, Subversion uses it to decide on treating a file as a text file or a binary file.</li>
        <li><b>svn:keywords</b> This property tells Subversion for which terms (e.g., "$Author$") keyword 
        substitution should be applied in the file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Attaching metadata to a file in the repository has to be done manually: a subversion command needs
      to be issued for every property of every file that needs to be configured.  This means that setting correct
      metadata on an existing codebase is a very labor intensive and error-prone process.  Moreover, when
      adding new files to the repository, one should remember to set the correct metadata on the file.
      </p>
      <p>It seems obvious that this process should be somehow automated to be effective.  An important
      observation here is that, typically, the same types of files will need the same metadata.  So, only a
      mechanism is needed to indicate that the metadata of a certain type of files needs to be configured with a
      given set of properties.  Subversion actually implements such a mechanism.  Sadly, Subversion only supports
      this as a client-side configuration option.  This means that every developer would need to use the same configuration
      (for this particular option) at all times to ensure that new files are consistently initialized with correct metadata.
      </p>
      <p>We believe that the latter mechanism is still error-prone and, for this reason, we decided to develop a
      script that visits all files in a given repository and corrects or adds metadata when needed.  Meet
      <b>svn_spider</b>!

      <div class="title">Using svn_spider</div>
      <p>svn_spider is a Ruby script that visits every file (using the Subversion api) in a given set of Subversion repositories
      to correct and add metadata as needed.  Both Ruby and the Subversion Ruby bindings are required dependencies of
      the svn_spider script.  The script can be run manually from the command line, but will typically be launched at regular
      intervals from a cron-like system.  A sample configuration file is included with the svn_spider download.
