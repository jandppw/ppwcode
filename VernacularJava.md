# Introduction #

Not all of our vernacular can be put in code. Some parts we can only describe in text. Specifics for Java projects are listed or discussed here. These are extensions to the [general vernacular](Vernacular.md).

In general, the vernacular we use on outside projects is the same as the guidelines and "ways of doing things" we also apply to [ppwcode projects](ppwcodeJava.md). Here, we will mention only where the vernacular for outside projects differs from the internal guidelines.
