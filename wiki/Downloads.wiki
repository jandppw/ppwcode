#summary About downloads

For now, we will not use the Google Code download feature.

=Java projects=

Since all Java projects use Maven 2, we deem the Maven 2 repository sufficient as a distribution mechanism.
It can be found at http://www.ppwcode.org/java/maven2repo/.

=Other projects=

Currently, the only non-Java project is svn_spider, which is a Ruby script.
This project is avaiable as a download from the following page http://www.ppwcode.org/svn/.
