#summary Applying the Apache License v2 to Java source code files
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The Apache License v2 is applied to pieces of text by adding a notice at the top of the file. This page describes how this is done exactly for Java source code files.

= Details =

For source code Java files, you *must* the following mantra, at the top of the file (line 1):
{{{
/*<license>
Copyright [inceptionYear] - $Date$ by PeopleWare n.v..

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
You may obtain a copy of the License at

    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

limitations under the License.
</license>*/
}}}

Furthermore, the following annotations *must* be added to each class, to carry the copyright and license information into the class file:
{{{
@Copyright("[inceptionYear] - $Date$, PeopleWare n.v.")
@License(APACHE_V2)
@SvnInfo(revision = "$Revision$",
         date     = "$Date$")
public class _MyClass_ ...
}}}


It is not necessary to add the `HeadURL` keyword to Java files: a Java source file can easily be identified by the package and class name.
