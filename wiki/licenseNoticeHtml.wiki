#summary Applying the Apache License v2 to HTML files

= Introduction =

The Apache License v2 is applied to pieces of text by adding a notice at the top of the file. This page describes how this is done exactly for HTML files.

= Details =

For HTML files, you *must* use the following comment, immediately following the root tag (if you add comments outside the root tag, your file is no longer well-formed XML):
{{{

}}}

Furthermore, you *must* add a footer, with the anchors adapted to refer correctly to the 'LICENSE' and 'NOTICE' files:
{{{
<div class="footer">

<table>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">$HeadURL$</td>
  </tr>
    <td>$Date$</td>
    <td>$Revision$</td>
  </tr>
</table
</div>
