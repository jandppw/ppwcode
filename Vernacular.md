# Introduction #

Apart from vernaculars in code, there are other experience based "ways of doing things", "results of evolutions of the teams", "choices", we have made, mostly for good reasons (al be it sometimes that more study is not worth the time). These non-code parts of our vernacular are documented here in the wiki.

For more information about the vernaculars, see http://www.ppwcode.org/vernacular.
