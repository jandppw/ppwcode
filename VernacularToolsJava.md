# Introduction #

In this section we discuss which tools are used in Java software development projects in general (client projects, outside ppwcode). This section only discusses Java-specific tools. This is an extension on the [general section](VernacularTools.md).

In general, the guidelines for [ppwcode Java projects](pwpcodeToolsJava.md) apply to projects outside ppwcode too. Here, we only mention differences.


# Details #

There are no deviations from the ppwcode tooling guide at this time.
